9. cheers. it's a show
10. i added more stuff
- this is here too
11. was that other line there? adding random stuff here. i'll add those things too.
- maybe the line is needed (-)
- yas that was missing. 
- trying a few more things. Such as a super long sentence. how long will it go? kinda sounds like how low can you go with the whole limbo thing. I dunno. here it goes. 
I'm testing the branch names again.
the format is turning out different than I expected. that's ok though. 
this is a pretty long readme. i feel like it explains things though. well not really, but it's a nice thought. 
- another bullet point is gonna make this list look real nice clark. 
- still testing PRs n such
- hows this going
- is this still working? branch test for this
is this the longest readme or wat?
it is quite long. gonna get even longer. just you watch. 
oops just forgot to change stuff. more changes for testing.
